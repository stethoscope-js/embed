### Issues

We use the [stethoscope-js/stethoscope](https://github.com/stethoscope-js/stethoscope) repository for issues for all projects, including this one.

## üíª Usage

To use the web app, you have to visit a URL like the following:

https://stethoscope.js.org/embed/?repo=AnandChowdhary%2Flife&api=rescuetime-time-tracking&latest=top-overview.weeks

You can simple embed this using an HTML `<iframe>` element:

```html
<iframe title="RescueTime data" src="https://stethoscope.js.org/embed/?repo=AnandChowdhary%2Flife&api=rescuetime-time-tracking&latest=top-overview.weeks"></iframe>
```

In the above example, the query parameters are the following, URL encoded:

- `repo`: Your repository on GitHub, e.g., `AnandChowdhary/life`
- `api`: The data you want to visualize, e.g., `rescuetime-time-tracking`, which corresponds to the directory in [`./data`](./data)
- `latest`: The visualization to display, based on the specific `api.json` keys, e.g., `top-overview.days`

Here are some more visualization of real-time data from my life:

- Sleep tracking: [this week](https://stethoscope.js.org/embed/?repo=AnandChowdhary%2Flife&api=oura-sleep&latest=total.weeks) ¬∑ [this month](https://stethoscope.js.org/embed/?repo=AnandChowdhary%2Flife&api=oura-sleep&latest=total.days) ¬∑ [this year](https://stethoscope.js.org/embed/?repo=AnandChowdhary%2Flife&api=oura-sleep&latest=total.months)
- Programming time: [this week](https://stethoscope.js.org/embed/?repo=AnandChowdhary%2Flife&api=wakatime-time-tracking&latest=weeks) ¬∑ [this month](https://stethoscope.js.org/embed/?repo=AnandChowdhary%2Flife&api=wakatime-time-tracking&latest=days) ¬∑ [this year](https://stethoscope.js.org/embed/?repo=AnandChowdhary%2Flife&api=wakatime-time-tracking&latest=months)

This is a real-time screenshot of the above RescueTime weekly overview URL:
